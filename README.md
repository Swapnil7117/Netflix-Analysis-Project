Just Launched My Power BI Netflix Dashboard Project!
I'm excited to share a dynamic Power BI dashboard I built to analyze Netflix Movies performance using real-world movies data. This project helped me dive deep into:
ğŸ“Œ Top 10 IMDB Score
 ğŸ“Œ Titels by Genre
 ğŸ“Œ Average Runtime By Genre
 ğŸ“Œ Language Distribution By Title
 ğŸ“Œ IMDB Score Frequancy
  ğŸ“Œ Count Of Title By Year
 ğŸ“Œ Key KPIs like Total Titles, Average Score, Average Runtime
ğŸ’¡ Tools Used: Power BI, DAX, Data Modeling , and Visual Design
This was a great opportunity to sharpen my BI skills and turn raw data into business insights. Feedback and suggestions are always welcome! ğŸ˜Š
